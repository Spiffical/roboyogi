        "I work with neural networks in my masters research to predict properties of stars, so I wanted to work on a project related to this but which could teach me about modern neural network architectures and methods I haven't yet used. Through becoming familiar with other architectures, it might allow me more creative insight when tackling problems in my research. Instead of sticking to the pure science route for this project, however, I wanted to choose a project that I could have a little fun with, one which was perhaps leaning more towards art than science. I thought that a project in the field of natural language processing (NLP) would suit these goals well. \n",

Neural networks have in large part solved the image domain but there’s still a lot of work to be done with language. Nevertheless, there have been some impressive results publushed, like the now famous article [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/) in which it was shown how a recurrent neural network (RNN) could produce novel texts ranging from Shakespeare to the Linux Kernel. Neural networks being used in NLP (and more generally data which has structure in time) has fascinated me since I read that article and so I wanted to get my hands dirty with some of the modern methods used for this.\n",

Well, the ancient Indian practice of yoga has in large part been completely warped and modified by our modern culture, often resulting in today’s average practitioner oblivious to and separated from its meditative and spiritual roots. To take this separation a step further and complete the transition of yoga entering our digital world, I wanted to create the world’s first robot yoga instructor. "

        "RNNs are a unique type of NN that take an input vector (e.g a word) and a hidden state (which only the NN sees) and produces a new hidden state. This new hidden state retains information, i.e. has memory, of the last input vector, such that when a new input vector is sent through the NN, its output depends on the previous input vector. Chaining this process together means that words can be sequentially  sent through the NN, each time producing a new hidden state which contains information about the previous words in the sentence. The output prediction of the RNN is thus dependent on information from all previous hidden states:"

The output of the RNN no longer depends on only the last hidden state: rather, it considers a weighted sum of all previous hidden states.

In the case of a sentence, this translates to the RNN focusing on important words, leading to more coherent sentences and a better understanding of the structure of language.  "

In practice the top 3-5 words are used and *randomly sampled*. This random sampling helps ensure diverse outputs, leading to more creative outputs. Due to its random nature, sometimes this sampling technique can result in nonsensical output. This is fixed by increasing the probability of the most probable words, and decreasing the probability of the least probable words. This tweaking of probabilities is parameterized by something called the ***temperature***, where a temperature of 0 leads to only the most probable words being used (and therefore uncreative output) and a temperature of 1.0 leading to more random output. Typically a value for temperature somewhere in between is chosen to achieve a balance between coherent sentences and creativity.\n",

        "**The bias in the training set is clearly identifiable, given that almost all of the examples begin the same way. Roboyogi has clearly understood how to start a yoga practice, however, by welcoming everyone and setting up the intro to the routine. The sentences generated are mostly coherent, and the sequences of moves for the most part could be performed by a human. Unfortunately, the long term structure sort of breaks down, revealing the inability of this method to generate long yoga routines with coherent structure throughout. **"

        "Roboyogi is quite limited in its ability to produce yoga routines due to a few reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The dataset is currently biased towards whoever is dominating the Youtube yoga market, and therefore the output mostly reflects their style of teaching.\n",
        "2.  I would have liked to spend more time tweaking hyper parameters.\n",
        "3.  The dataset is limited in size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Unfortunately it does not currently seem simple or possible to remove the first limitation. The second limitation can easily be removed by working on this project further.\n",
        "\n",
        "The third limitation presents an interesting problem. The output of Roboyogi is currently not perfect (sometimes incoherent and repeats itself), likely due to not having access to enough data to train on. One way of mitigating this limitation is to adopt the [strategy implemented by a team at OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/) which produced incredible results: pre-train a model on a massive dataset of general text from the internet, allowing for a larger and more complex architecture which can accommodate longer input sequences. This pre-trained network would have a deeper understanding of language and could produce much longer and more coherent yoga routines. \n",
        "\n",
        "Despite these limitations, Roboyogi can generate pretty creative output, and certainly it can generate novel and coherent sequences of yoga poses. This project was a lot of fun and I consider it a complete success given the constraints!"
